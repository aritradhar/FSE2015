\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

Ensuring program correctness statically is an undecidable problem. Thus there is
always a tradeoff between precision and scalability that static program analysis
must balance. Static analysis achieves high scalability by making sound
approximations, which typically leads to false positives. Complex programming
logic and data coming from diverse sources make the already hard problem worse.
As a result, successful execution of a real application can never be guaranteed,
and unexpected failures may happen. These failures often result in applications
throwing runtime exceptions, which if not handled correctly may crash the
application.

\begin{figure}[t]

\begin{lstlisting}
public static String getPathNoEndSeparator
        (String filename) {
  return doGetPath(filename, 0);
}
private static String doGetPath
        (String filename, int separatorAdd) {
  if(filename == null) return null;
  int prefix = getPrefixLength(filename);
  if (prefix < 0) return null;
  int index = indexOfLastSeparator(filename);
  if ((prefix >= filename.length()) || (index < 0))
        return "";
  return filename.substring(prefix,
        index + separatorAdd);
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

Code~\ref{snippet:exampleRepairing2} corresponds to methods from
\code{fileUtils} class in Apache Common IO library. The method
\code{getPathNoEndSeparator()} throws a \code{StringIndexOutOfBounds} exception,
which originates from statement \code{return filename.substring(prefix, index +
separatorAdd)} on line 13 when the method is called with parameter
\code{"/foo.xml"}.  Here, the value of \code{prefix} as returned by the method
\code{getPrefixLength} is 1. It fails to satisfy the constraint implied by the
program condition \code{prefix <= index + separatorAdd} for \code{substring}
method, which ensures that \code{beginIndex} cannot be greater than
\code{endIndex}. As a result, the exception is thrown.

} catch(IndexOutOfBoundsException ex) {
   int length = filename.length;

   temp = filename.substring(
   getStart(prefix,t,length),getEnd(prefix,t,length));
}
return temp;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

A closer inspection of this code snippet shows that the string variable
\code{filename} invokes two methods, namely \code{length} and \code{substring}
on lines $11$ and $13$ respectively. \java\ \code{String} API documentation
specifies that \code{length} does not throw any runtime exceptions. The only
exception that this invoke statement can throw is when the receiver object
referenced by \code{filename} is \code{null}. However, the check on line $7$
indicates that this situation would not arise. The method \code{substring} may
throw \code{IndexOutOfBoundsException} exception that can potentially crash the
program. A good patch to handle this failure should take into account all of
these observations. 

Code~\ref{snippet:exampleRepairing3} presents the patch automatically generated
by \tool. This patch replaces the invoke statement on line 13 in
Code~\ref{snippet:exampleRepairing2}, which is now wrapped within a
\code{try--catch} block. The \code{catch} corresponding to
\code{IndexOutOfBoundsException}
% is added on line 15
ensures that control passes
to the catch block only when the exception is thrown. Line 20 shows two method
calls namely \code{getStart} and \code{getEnd} that are inserted by \tool. These
methods, using the knowledge about the length of \code{filename} acquired with
the help of the code on line 17, compute legally correct indexes required by
\code{substring} method to satisfy the constraint related to \code{beginIndex}
and \code{endIndex}. Method \code{substring} can now regenerate the substring
ensuring that the method call will not fail. The actual patch provided by the
developers is semantically similar to the one developed by \tool, and both
versions of the program generate the exact the same output.


\section{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:definition}

Let the behavior $\mathcal{B}$ of program $\mathcal{P}$ for input $\mathcal{I}$
be a sequence of data values \textless\ $b_1, \ldots, b_n$ \textgreater\ shared
with the environment, where these values may be used to print information on
screen, access and manipulate files and databases, and exchange data with other
processes or threads. For brevity, we assume that the program is sequential.
However, our formalization and arguments can be extended to multi-threaded
programs and their behaviors.

Consider the behavior $\mathcal{B}$ to be composed of $\mathcal{B}_nc =$
\textless\ $b_{1_c}, \ldots, b_{n_c}$ \textgreater\ and $\mathcal{B}_n =$
\textless\ $b_{1_n}, \ldots, b_{n_n}$ \textgreater, where elements in
$\mathcal{B}_c$ consist of critical values that form core functionality of the program, while elements in
$\mathcal{B}_n$ are noncritical values with respect to the core functionality of
the program.
% We consider behaviors of the two programs, $\mathcal{P}$ and
% $\mathcal{P}'$, equivalent if their critical components are identical for same
% program inputs. Formally, $\mathcal{P} \equiv \mathcal{P}' \iff$
% ($\mathcal{B}_c
% = \mathcal{B}'_c \land \mathcal{I} = \mathcal{I}'$). In other words, for
% equivalent program behaviors their noncritical behaviors do not matter.
%  
% Let $\mathcal{B}_{I_f}$ be the behavior for $\mathcal{P}$ under failure input
% $\mathcal{I}_f$. and let the data element that correspond to the failure does
% not belong to $\mathcal{B}_{{I_f}_c}$. Let the element be $b_{m_n}$.
% 
% Let p be an element of P which results in a failure under cer-
% tain input I f . Let the intended behavior of P under this input be
% BI f , and let the data element that correspond to the failure does not
% belong to BI f c . Let the element be bmn .
%  
% In this work, we restrict our approach to data values that are strings.
% 
If $\mathcal{B}_{\theta}$ is the behavior for $\mathcal{P}$ under failure input
$\theta$, then our approach attempts to
% i) find a minimal $p$ that was associated with the failure,
% ii) ensures that $b_{m_n} \not\in \mathcal{B}_{{I_f}_c}$,
develop a program patch to convert $\mathcal{P}$ to $\mathcal{P}'$,
% while ensuring that:
such that 
% \begin{mybullet}
%  \item
 $\mathcal{P}'$ does not violate the core behavior of $\mathcal{P}$ under
failure, \ie\ $\mathcal{B}'_{\theta_c}$ is same as the intended behavior
$\mathcal{B}_{\theta_c}$.
% , and
%  \item
Note that resulting behavior $\mathcal{B}'_{\theta_n}$ may not be
equivalent to $\mathcal{B}_{\theta_n}$.
% is close to the intended
% behavior $\mathcal{B}_{\theta_n}$. In other words, the difference between
%  $\mathcal{B}'_{\theta_n}$ and 
% $\mathcal{B}_{\theta_n}$ is within limits acceptable to the programmer.
% \end{mybullet}


% \subsection{Goals}
% \label{sec:tool:goals}

In this work, we restrict our approach to \code{string} data values. We identify
the broad design goals for a technique to automatically repair malformed strings or
incorrect handling of strings as follows:

% i) identifies the statements which might be vulnerable to string-related
% errors,
% and are less critical to the functionality of the application such that
% suboptimal behavior might be acceptable,
% iii) generates patches by identifying constraints on the string data and if
% required, tweaks \code{String} API  parameters to regenerate legally correct
% string data,
% iv) optimizes the number of statements to be patched by retaining only the
% ones
% that need to be protected,

\myparagraph{(i) High patch fidelity} We require that the patched program must
preserve the intended program behavior, \ie\ the patch must be precise, and
should not induce any undesirable control flows in the repaired program. 
This goal naturally follows from the problem definition. However, we set two
more goals associated with the security and performance of the technique.

\myparagraph{(ii) Non-invasive instrumentation} We require that the technique
must ensure no side-effects (aside from optimally repairing objects) during
normal program execution, and activate patches only when the program is
guaranteed to crash.

\myparagraph{(iii) Low system overhead} We desire that the patched program must
incur no runtime overhead during normal program execution, and only negligible
overhead in case of failures.
