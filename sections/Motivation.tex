\subsection{Historical Context}
\label{subsec:historicalContext}

In recent past, we have seen couple of disastrous failure of critical military
and civilian infrastructure system due to system failure/crash which is results
of some very common runtime exceptions.

\begin{mylist}
  
  \item In USS Yorktown, complete failure in propulsion and navigation system by
  a simple divide-by-zero exception in flight deck database.
  
  \item AT\&T telephone network failure causing by one faulty switch causing ATC
  commutation blackout.
  
  \item Air-Traffic Control System in LA Airport lost communication with all 400
  airplanes caused by a system crash triggered by integer (32bit) overflow.
  
  \item Mars rover curiosity B-side computer memory overflow causing OS suspend
  and multiple restart.
  
  \item Trans-Siberian Gas Pipeline Explosion in 1982 by deliberate bugs in
  software controlled valves.
  
  \item Near-blackout of the national grid in Austria caused by faulty function
  call.
  
  
\end{mylist}

\caption{Most frequent runtime exceptions from stack overflow}
\label{tab:stackoverlow}
\end{table}

We have analyzed data from stack overflow and we looked for \java runtime
exception which are discussed most frequently. In the
table~\ref{tab:stackoverlow}, the data we find is tabulated along with their
occurrences and percentages.

From the table it is clear that null pointer exception in \java is not only the
most frequent but also the most dominant runtime exception having share of more
than $50$.
