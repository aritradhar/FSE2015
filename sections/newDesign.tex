\label{fig:overallDesign}
\end{figure}

\myparagraph{\underline{Key Idea}} \tool\ leverages a combination of program 
analysis techniques to precisely identify program instrumentation points, and
builds upon custom algorithms to generate targeted, high quality patches for
repairing programs with potential runtime exceptions, while still satisfying
goals mentioned in \xref{sec:definition}.

Figure~\ref{fig:overallDesign} shows \tool's workflow, which involves three
main stages. First, \tool\ uses program analysis techniques to precisely
identify points of interest, \ie\ \code{string} objects or API arguments that
must be repaired to prevent runtime exceptions. In the second stage, \tool\ leverages
custom algorithms to generate relevant patches. Specifically, \tool\ performs
intra-procedural static and dynamic analyses to identify and evaluate
constraints on the string objects under consideration. Third, \tool\ uses the
constraints evaluated in the earlier stage to programatically generate and embed
patches inside \texttt{catch} blocks to ensure that they do not get activated
during normal program execution.

\subsection{Identification of Instrumentation Points}
\label{sec:tool:stage1}

In this stage, \tool\ leverages a combination of program analyses to accurately
determine the minimum set of points of interest where instrumentation is
required to repair. We list several techniques below that help \tool\ achieve
precision.

\myparagraph{(i) Taint analysis} The main purpose of taint analysis is to
precisely identify which program statements can be patched (possibly even
suboptimally) without affecting the program's control flow, \ie\ affect only
objects that are generated and stay within the application throughout their
lifetime. While this principle is not a binding constraint, it ensures that
\tool's repairing mechanism does not adversely affect critical program behavior.
We specify a generic set of sensitive sources and sinks for each input program,
to identify critical program paths where repaired \code{String} objects
% (possibly suboptimal)
must not flow. For example, \tool\ does not repair
 statements that lie along a control flow path leading to an I/O sink such as file
 system, console, network, and GUI.

The taint analysis module takes as input the compiled byte code intended to be
repaired, and generates a control flow graph identifying program statements that
lie along paths from sensitive sources to sensitive sinks. Since, \tool\ targets
\code{String} objects in particular, it must support taint propagation for all
\java\ APIs that support string manipulation, including \code{StringBuffer} and
\code{StringBuilder}.
\tool\ makes a default, conservative assumption that all objects
leaving the system have potential to trigger unintended behavior. Thus, all
\code{String} objects (whether generated or assigned)
that lie along the tainted path from a sensitive source to a sensitive sink are
marked as \textit{unsafe} to patch. Subsequently, \tool\ does not repair such
\code{String} objects.

\tool's configuration further enables developers to specify their own sets of
sensitive sources and sinks, and exclude specific tainted paths.
Tables~\ref{table:TaintSources} and \ref{table:TaintSinks} list common
sensitive sources and sinks for several classes in \java.

\code{java.io.Writer} & \code{write}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:TaintSinks}
\end{table}

\myparagraph{(ii) Call graph analysis} \tool\ leverages call graph analysis to
further improve the precision for finding instrumentation points. Although
unlikely, it is possible that the developers may themselves handle code that
raises runtime exceptions. \tool\ must not instrument program points that
are explicitly handled by the developers, since repairing such statements
would definitely alter the intended control flow.

Checked runtime exceptions may be placed in the (i) same method, or (ii)
upstream in the call chain. While handling the former scenario is trivial,
\tool\ handles the latter case by identifying all possible call chains (in
the \textit{call graph}) involving the concerned method using reverse breadth
first search, and determining ancestor methods where the call site was wrapped in
\code{try-catch} block of compatible exception type.

\myparagraph{(iii) Reaching definitions analysis} Taint and call graph analyses
together provide a set of program points to be instrumented with the
patch. However, this set can be further pruned. \tool\ performs \textit{reaching
definitions} analysis to skip marked statements if
(i) the \code{String} variables contained in such statements have already been
patched upstream in the method, and (ii) the variables have not been redefined along any
path that originates from the patched statement. This analysis further reduces
instrumentation points in a program.

\subsection{Patch Generation}
\label{sec:tool:stage2}

The output from the first stage is essentially a set of program points,
typically bytecodes or some other intermediate representation, denoting
\code{String} objects or APIs that are safe to repair. Once these
instrumentation points have been identified, \tool\ determines the
possible patches that can be applied to each of them. Specifically, a program
patch constitutes a set of constraints on either the \code{String} object or the
parameters to the \code{String} API under consideration, such that the new
repaired \code{String} object that is generated satisfies all constraints. Thus
the patched program does not throw any runtime exceptions.

\tool's patch generation mechanism involves two main parts (i) constraint
collection and evaluation, and (ii) code generation. We now describe \tool's
patch generation mechanism in detail.

\myparagraph{Constraint collection and evaluation} \tool\ leverages a hybrid
approach to collect all possible constraints that must be satisfied, and thus
generates a high quality patch to repair the program. A constraint on a
\code{String} object is defined as a set of permissible values that uniquely
define the string. \tool\ uses a \textit{constraint store} to maintain a set that 
includes constraints on minimum and maximum
lengths, along with a set of permissible prefixes and substrings, as shown in
Table~\ref{table:constraint}.

\caption{\bf Dynamic patching strategy for \code{String} objects.}
\label{algo:patchingStrategyDynamic}
\end{algorithm}

The hybrid approach has a static component that makes a forward pass over the
program to collect constraints on \code{String} objects, such as their length or
prefix. \tool\ invokes the dynamic component if there are constraints such that
the constraint set cannot be evaluated. In such scenarios, \tool\ (i) generates
a patch that itself dynamically collects constraint information, (ii) augments
it with the previously collected static constraint details, and (iii) evaluates
these constraints on the fly to generate repaired \code{String} objects, which
do not cause the program to throw runtime exceptions. \tool\ propagates
constraints to ensure that the static constraint collection works correctly if
the conditional statements involve any variables that are redefined during the
collection and can be calculated statically. \tool\ only collects constraints
that are directly associated to \code{String} objects.
Algorithms~\ref{algo:patchingStrategy} and~\ref{algo:patchingStrategyDynamic}
give an overview of this hybrid approach.

\begin{mylist}

 \item \textbf{Static constraint collection}: \tool's static constraint
collection phase identifies all constraints.
Algorithm~\ref{algo:constraintCollection} briefly describes the steps to
populate the constraint store. Specifically, \tool\ \ignore{iterates over all
program code} identifies and analyzes conditional statements involving string
objects \ignore{of the form} such as \code{if (st.length() == $5$)}. It
considers only those constraints that the object must satisfy to ensure control
flows through one of the \textit{normal} branches of the conditional. A normal
branch is one that does not represent an erroneous control flow. For example, a
branch that encounters a statement \code{System.err.print()} would represent an
erroneous control flow. \ignore{In other words, \tool\ only considers the
conditional expressions in the branches that do not involve any exceptions or
error paths.}
% 
Code~\ref{snippet:constraintCollection} shows a string variable with several
constraints as defined by the \code{if} statements on lines $2$-$5$. The first
three constraints are static as all of them can be evaluated at the compilation
time. By analyzing these statements, \tool\ populates the constraint store
depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:constraintExample}. \ignore{Note that \tool\ also evaluates $OP$ (in
Algorithm~\ref{algo:constraintCollection}) when collecting constraints, in case
$OP$ is a composite mathematical expression $f(x,y,z,...)$, such as $x + y * z$,
where all $x$, $y$ and $z$ are known to be numeric.}\ignore{ When collecting
constraints, \tool\ also evaluates composite mathematical expressions, such as
$x + y * z$, where all $x$, $y$ and $z$ are numeric (see
Algorithm~\ref{algo:constraintCollection}).}

 \item \textbf{Dynamic constraint collection}: The constraint set is populated
at the end of the static phase. \tool\ leverages Algorithm~\ref{algo:constraint}
to evaluate these constraints and determine the potential safe values of the
\code{String} object under consideration. However, there are scenarios where
there exist potentially conflicting constraints or no permissible values of the
constraints can be calculated statically.

ConstraintStore.updateSet("<foo()>", st, temp);
st = GenerateStringDynamic.init("<foo()>", st);

\end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

For example, function \code{foo} in Code~\ref{snippet:constraintCollection}
performs a series of checks on a user-entered string \code{st} before computing
a substring on it. Since the constraints on \code{st} cannot be completely
collected and evaluated statically, \tool\ instruments the code with statements
to dynamically collect constraint information, augments them with previously
known static constraints, and evaluates these constraints at runtime.
Specifically, \tool\ instruments the bytecode with constraint collection code
just before the conditional statements under consideration.
Code~\ref{snippet:exCode2} depicts the example in
Code~\ref{snippet:constraintCollection} after \tool's instrumentation. When the
constraints in the source are complex, \tool\ relies on its base framework to
simplify them and then evaluates only the ones that are related to strings.

\vspace{-0.1cm} 
\subsection{Code Generation}
\label{sec:tool:stage2:generation}

Code generation is done either statically or dynamically depending on how
the constraints are evaluated. In either scenario, a key component of code
generation is \textit{object repairing}. Additionally, in certain cases
where constraints cannot be satisfied, either statically or dynamically or
both, \tool\ resorts to \textit{parameter tweaking}.

\begin{mylist}

 \item \textbf{Object repairing}: \tool\ generates the code for the repaired
object under consideration after all the constraints have been collected and
evaluated. If the constraints are resolved statically, then \tool\ updates its
constraint data store and instruments the corresponding bytecodes appropriately.
However, in case the patch requires dynamic constraint collection, \tool\ embeds
the code to dynamically collect constraints and generates the patch as well.
Lines $4, 8, 10$ and $14$ in Code~\ref{snippet:exCode2} update the constraint
set and generate the repaired object.

\caption{\bf Parameter tweaking based \code{String} patching.}
\label{algo:stringPatchParametr}
\end{algorithm}

 \item \textbf{Parameter tweaking}: It is possible that as a side-effect of
object repairing, the newly patched object may throw runtime errors when invoked
with certain \code{String} APIs. The snippet \code{c = s.charAt(4)} may still
throw runtime errors even if \code{s} has been repaired. This is possible if the
repaired \code{s} has a length less than $4$. In such scenarios, \tool\ patches
the code with a \code{try-catch} block around the offending API call, and
appropriately inserts the repaired code in the \code{catch} block but with
tweaks to the API arguments to ensure that no further runtime exception is
thrown (see Code~\ref{snippet:exCode3}). For example, if the length of the
string is greater than $4$, then the API works similar to default \code{charAt}
API. However, if the length is $3$, then line $4$ is invoked with both arguments
equal to string length, \ie\ $3$. Note that parameter tweaking is leveraged to
counter a potentially suboptimal object repair that may throw cascading
exceptions. Algorithm~\ref{algo:stringPatchParametr} briefly outlines the
mechanism to correctly set the parameters for the offending string API.

}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}
\end{mylist}

\vspace{-0.1cm} 
\subsection{Instrumentation}
\label{sec:tool:stage3}

\tool\ embeds the repair in a \code{try-catch} ladder to ensure that the patches
do not get activated during normal program execution, thereby minimizing any
side-effects of repairing and preventing any inadvertent changes to the
program's intended control flow.

An important task in the instrumentation stage is to determine the kind of
exceptions that may be thrown, and appropriately construct the \code{catch}
blocks. While most APIs throw only a single subclass of \code{RuntimeException},
it is possible that a statement may throw more than one subclasses, such as
\code{NullPointerException} and \code{StringIndexOutOfBoundsException}. \tool\
generates a \code{catch} ladder for each kind of exception, which facilitates
exception-specific repairing as well. In other words, a single patch
may get distributed over multiple \code{catch} blocks, which is achieved with
the help of a constraint representation model.



\myparagraph{Constraint representation model}  We use a finite state machine
(FSM) to model the behavior of \java\ \code{String} API, and apply it to drive
the generation of exception-specific \code{catch} blocks. This model is
precomputed based on the \java\ \code{Strings} API documentation. Formally, we
define the constraint representation FSM model $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ as
follows:
\begin{mybullet}
 \item $Q$: Set of \emph{legal} (safe) and \emph{illegal} (error) states, where
$|Q| = 2$. %% states.

 \item $\Sigma$: Set of symbols. Each symbol is defined as a tuple ($\zeta$,
$\eta$, $\Lambda$), where $\zeta$ is a \code{String} API operation, $\eta$ is
the type of an exception and $\Lambda = \{\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n\}$  is
the set of constraints. A constraint $\lambda_i$ is defined as a constraint on
a string that must be satisfied to allow successful execution of $\zeta$.

 \item $\delta$: Transition function. $safe \rightarrow safe$ is a safe
transition and $safe \rightarrow error$ corresponds to the constraint violation.

 \item $q_0$: Starting state, here $q_0 = safe$.

 \item $F$: Singleton set of accept states which contains $q_0$.
\end{mybullet}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.28]{images/automataString.pdf}
\caption{\bf Partial constraint representation model.}
\label{fig:constraintautomata}
\end{figure}


A partial constraint representation model is depicted in 
Figure~\ref{fig:constraintautomata}. It essentially specifies the constraints
that are associated with \code{substring} method and
\code{IndexOutofBoundException} exception that can be thrown by the method. A
complete model would have several such self-looping transitions corresponding to
other \java\ \code{String} API methods. The repairing mechanism gets triggered
when an exception is thrown while performing a string operation after at least
one of the constraints on the structure of the associated string is violated.
This is represented by the transition labeled by \code{other}. The patches
essentially support the same semantics identified by the transitions with the
help of \code{catch} blocks.
