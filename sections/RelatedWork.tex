\subsection{Recent Works on Data Structure Repairing}
\label{subsec:RecWorksDataStructure}

Automated data-structure repairing techniques are there in the literature for a
while. In the papers~\cite{conf/oopsla/DemskyR03, Demsky03automaticdata,
conf/icse/DemskyR05, conf/issre/DemskyR03, conf/issta/DemskyEGMPR06} the authors
mostly concentrated on specific data-structures like \emph{FAT-32}, \emph{ext2},
\emph{CTAS} (a set of air-traffic control tools developed at the NASA Ames
research center) and repairing them. The authors represented a specification
language by which they able to see consistency property these data-structure.
Given the specification, they able to detect the inconsistency of these
data-structures and repair them.
The repairing strategy involves detecting the consistency constraints for the
particular data structure, for the violation, they replace the error condition
with correct proposition. In the paper~\cite{conf/icse/DemskyR05}, the authors
Brian Demsky and Martin C. Rinard proposed repair strategy by goal-directed
reasoning. This involves translating the data-structure to a abstract model by a
set of model definition rules. The actual repair involves model reconstruction
and statically mapped it to a data structure update. In their
paper~\cite{conf/oopsla/2007} authors Bassem Elkarablieh, Sarfraz Khurshid, Duy
Vu, Kathryn S. McKinley proposed the idea to statically analyze the data
structure to access the information like recurrent fields and local fields. They
used their technique to some well known data structures like singly linked list,
sorted list, doubly liked list, N-ary tree, AVL tree, binary search tree,
disjoint set, red-black tree, Fibonacci heap etc.

\subsection{Works on Software Patching}
\label{subsec:RecWorksSoftPatch}

In their paper~\cite{conf/sosp/PerkinsKLABCPSSSWZER09}, authors Jeff H.
Perkins, Sunghun Kim, Samuel Larsen, Saman P. Amarasinghe, Jonathan Bachrach and
Michael Carbin, Carlos Pacheco, Frank Sherwood, Stelios Sidiroglou, Greg
Sullivan, Weng-Fai Wong,Yoav Zibin, Michael D. Ernst and Martin C. Rinard
presented their \emph{Clear view} system which works on windows x86 binaries
without requiring any source code. They used invariants analysis for which they
used Daikon~\cite{journals/scp/ErnstPGMPTX07}. They mostly patched security
vulnerabilities by some candidate repair patches.

Fan Lon et al in their paper~\cite{conf/pldi/LongSR14} presented their new
system \emph{RCV} which recovers applications from divide-by-zero and
null-deference error. Their tool replaces \emph{SIGFPE} and \emph{SIGSEGV}
signal handler with its own handler. The approach simply works by assigning zero
at the time of divide-by-zero error, read zero and ignores write at the time of
null-deference error. Their implementation was on $x86$ and $x86-64$ binaries
and they also implemented a dynamic taint analysis to see the effect of
their
patching until the program stabilizes which they called as \emph{error
shepherding}.

\subsection{Genetic Programming, Evolutionary Computation}
\label{subsec:RecWorksGeneric}

Reserch works on program repair based on genetic programming and evolutionary
computation can be found in the paper of Stephanie Forrest, ThanhVu Nguyen,
Westley Weimer and Claire Le Goues~\cite{conf/gecco/2009g} and Westley Weimer,
Stephanie Forrest, Claire Le Goues, ThanhVu
Nguyen~\cite{journals/cacm/WeimerFGN10} respectively. In the papers, the authors
used genetic programming to generate and evaluate test cases. They used their
technique on the well known Microsoft Zune media player bug causing the
application to freeze up.
