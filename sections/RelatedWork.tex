\label{sec:relatedWork}

There has been considerable amount of research work done in the area of 
automated program repairing technique. Researchers have proposed several
approaches that include both static as well as dynamic approaches.

\paragraph{Data Structure Repairing}
%\label{subsec:RecWorksDataStructure}

Demsky and Rinard have proposed approaches that repair data structures ~\cite{
Demsky03automaticdata, conf/issre/DemskyR03,conf/oopsla/DemskyR03,
conf/issta/DemskyEGMPR06} the authors mostly concentrated on specific data-structures like \emph{FAT-32}, \emph{ext2},
\emph{CTAS} (a set of air-traffic control tools developed at the NASA Ames
research center) and repairing them. The authors represented a specification
language by which they able to see consistency property these data-structure.
Given the specification, they able to detect the inconsistency of these
data-structures and repair them.
The repairing strategy involves detecting the consistency constraints for the
particular data structure, for the violation, they replace the error condition
with correct proposition. In the paper~\cite{conf/icse/DemskyR05}, the authors
Demsky et al. proposed repair strategy by goal-directed reasoning. This involves
translating the data-structure to a abstract model by a set of model definition
rules. The actual repair involves model reconstruction and statically mapped it
to a data structure update. In the paper~\cite{conf/oopsla/2007} authors
Elkarablieh et al. proposed the idea to statically analyze the data structure to
access the information like recurrent fields and local fields. They used their
technique to some well known data structures like singly linked list, sorted
list, doubly liked list, N-ary tree, AVL tree, binary search tree, disjoint set,
red-black tree, Fibonacci heap etc.

\paragraph{Works on Software Patching}
%\label{subsec:RecWorksSoftPatch}

In their paper~\cite{conf/sosp/PerkinsKLABCPSSSWZER09}, authors Perkins et al.
presented their \emph{Clear view} system which works on windows x86 binaries
without requiring any source code. They used invariants analysis for which
they used Daikon~\cite{DBLP:journals/scp/ErnstPGMPTX07}. They mostly patched
security vulnerabilities by some candidate repair patches.

Fan Long et al. in their paper~\cite{conf/pldi/LongSR14} presented their new
system \emph{RCV} which recovers applications from divide-by-zero and
null-deference error. Their tool replaces \emph{SIGFPE} and \emph{SIGSEGV}
signal handler with its own handler. The approach simply works by assigning zero
at the time of divide-by-zero error, read zero and ignores write at the time of
null-deference error. Their implementation was on $x86$ and $x86-64$ binaries
and they also implemented a dynamic taint analysis to see the effect of
their
patching until the program stabilizes which they called as \emph{error
shepherding}.

\paragraph{Genetic Programming, Evolutionary Computation}
%\label{subsec:RecWorksGeneric}

Reserch works on program repair based on genetic programming and evolutionary
computation can be found in the paper of Forrest
et al.s~\cite{conf/gecco/2009g} and Weimer
et al.~\cite{DBLP:journals/cacm/WeimerFGN10} respectively. In the papers, the
authors used genetic programming to generate and evaluate test cases. They used their
technique on the well known Microsoft Zune media player bug causing the
application to freeze up.
