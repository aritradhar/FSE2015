\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


Developers invest a significant amount of time and human involvement in testing
and verification to make their software production ready. However, in spite of
this effort and the tools used to ensure its safety and security, the software
%invariably carries subtle bugs, which are often evident only when the software
%throws an exception and/or crashes entirely. The cost of a severe exception or a
%crash varies considerably depending on the criticality of the software, and
invariably carries subtle bugs, which are evident only when the software
throws an exception and crashes. The cost of a 
crash varies depending on the criticality of the software, and
whether it occurred during production or testing.

A software bug in production systems may result in huge monetary losses to the
tune of hundreds of millions of dollars for organizations running third-party
software~\cite{hp, amazon, hershey, nike}. Further, these organizations must
wait for the vendor to release a patch for the offending software, which may
take days or even weeks. If a major software bug strikes during the internal 
acceptance testing, it may significantly hamper the testing progress itself,
%thereby affecting the entire software release cycle, and negatively impact the
%testing efficiency. Additionally, the software testers may have to wait for the
thereby affecting the entire software release cycle.
Additionally, the software testers may have to wait for the
newer patched version before they resume the testing process. Lastly, any such
crash during a software's beta testing phase might frustrate the public
resulting in rejection of the product itself. In all of the above scenarios, it
would be extremely useful if a temporary program patch that not only saves the
%program from crashing and moreover, but also guarantees \textit{acceptable} (and
%close to the intended) behavior can be applied to the software on-the-fly.

Software failures that result in crashes often originate from subtle program
bugs that are related to unusual program inputs, unexpected environment changes,
or specific thread schedules. While crashes are always undesirable, they are
particularly annoying when they arise from \textit{non-critical} modules that
are not related to the core software functionality. For example,
Code~\ref{snippet:exampleRepairing1} depicts a bug in Apache Log4j library
version 2.0-beta9~\cite{ApacheLog4jBug} that crashed the entire logging
framework. It was reported as a major bug in spite of the fact that it occurred
in logging component. The object \code{priorVariables} is a \code{List} of
String. On line 4, there is no check on the variables to ensure that invariants
such as \code{offset + length <= chars.length}, \code{offset > 0}, and
\code{length > 0} hold.

In case of such failures, rather than allowing the application to crash,
organizations would prefer to collect diagnostic information to identify the
defect, and proceed with a sub-optimal execution run hoping that it will
eventually stabilize, or reveal a few more bugs.


Prior work~\cite{wei-issta-2010, Carbin:2011, conf/sosp/PerkinsKLABCPSSSWZER09,
conf/pldi/LongSR14} proposes several mechanisms to automatically fix incorrect
program behavior by generating program patches. These approaches either need a
complete system shutdown to apply a patch, or isolate the faulty part of a data
structure on the fly thereby limiting the functionality, or keep suppressing the
exceptions with a hope that a suboptimal behavior would be acceptable until the
application stabilizes.

In this work, we propose a novel hybrid approach that deals with failures
originating due to malformed strings, or incorrect handling of strings in \java\
%softwares. We target string objects for patching, in particular, for the
applications. We target string objects for patching, in particular, for the
following two reasons.
First, \java\ applications are typically built using libraries, and
\code{String} APIs are commonly used in third party
libraries~\cite{Kawachiya:2008:ARM:1449764.1449795, gc, techreport}.  In
order to understand the usage and potential involvement of \java\ string
objects in the application failures, we mined
\texttt{stackoverflow}~\cite{stackoverflow} for related posts. We observed that
almost $33$K out of $60$K posts contained \java\ string related exceptions,
indicating heavy string usage in programs.
Second, we exploit extensive domain knowledge about strings to
automatically synthesize high-quality patches.

\tool\ performs precise static analysis to identify program locations that are
vulnerable to string-related failures, and also the contexts under which they
trigger a failure. This enables repairing the program close to the point of
failure and generating precise patches that take into account the constraints on
the string objects.
%% preventing the failure propagation.
\tool\ further uses dynamic analysis to improve the precision of the patches
generated by the static analysis.

We applied \tool\ to patch $30$ bugs, several of them rated critical or major,
resulting from unhandled runtime exceptions from \java\ \code{String} APIs in
various hugely popular open-source libraries. Our evaluation shows that \tool\ 
develops precise patches that are semantically close to the ones developed by
the developers.

This work makes following contributions:
\begin{mylist}

\item We present the design and implementation of \tool\ (\xref{sec:overview},
\xref{sec:design} and \xref{sec:implementation}) that automatically generates effective
program patches to handle string-related errors.

\item We use a finite state machine (FSM) as a formalism (\xref{sec:design}) to
describe the behavior of \java\ \code{String} API, and apply it to drive the
generation of exception-specific patches.

\item  Our evaluation (\xref{sec:results}) indicates that \tool\ can effectively
produce patches that save programs from crashing due to failures originating
from known bugs. The results also gives insights into the characteristics of the
commonly occurring string problems.

\item Manual inspection of \tool-generated patches reveal that in most cases
they are semantically similar to the ones produced by the developers in the
later versions. 
Thus, \tool\ can also guide developers in the process of building patches.
