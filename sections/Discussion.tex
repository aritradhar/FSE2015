\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

In this section we discuss the weaknesses of \tool\ and also propose
remedies to overcome them.

\myparagraph{Focus on String APIs} \tool\ is heavily directed towards repairing 
 \code{String} objects and handling API
exceptions. While this may seem to be a limitation, we believe that \tool's
strength lies in the fact that it mines contextual data about runtime exceptions
related to \code{String} objects that helps development of intelligent patches.
Moreover, \tool's technique is generic and can be ported to any other class of
\java\ APIs. We leave this extension for the future.

\myparagraph{Lack of guarantee regarding patch correctness} \tool attempts to
generate precise patches considering the program context which avoids
cascading exceptions to a great extent producing the intended behavior in case
of failures. However, it still cannot give guarantees about elimination of cascading
exceptions, particularly when there are heavy object dependencies in the program.
In the future, we plan to support \tool\ with program invariants that would ensure 
acceptable behavior. The invariants can be specified by a programmer or can be
automatically generated with the help of training runs.

\myparagraph{Handling of limited constraints} The constraint data store used by
\tool\ is easy to build as it captures
limited number of fairly simple \code{String} characteristics which are used to
generate patching \code{String} objects. This approach may not be adequate particularly
if the program contains a large number of complex constraints. The quality of
\tool's patches would generally depend on the nature of its constraint solver,
which is pluggable. \tool's current solver is simple and can efficiently
handle a limited number of simple constraints. A more sophisticated off-the-shelf solver may improve
the repair quality. However, the current evaluation of the tool
on several library APIs described in Section~\ref{sec:results} indicates that the constraints that exist
in practice are normally less complex and are limited in number.
