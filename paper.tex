Runtime Exceptions are common types of exceptions which may lead to system crash
which leads to shutdown or restart. For may critical application such scenario
is unacceptable due to their nature which requires availability of the service. 
%Runtime exceptions may even leads to inconsistency of data in the system which
%may leads to further complications and expensive fixes.
Program bugs which causes runtime exceptions often go unnoticed at the time of
development as these exceptions are unchecked exceptions. The key issue is to
guide the program through some exception suppression procedure which will leads
the program to a consistent state hence improve the chance of surviving a fatal
crash. Here we consider such programs for which restart is not an option.

In this paper, we present a novel technique to recover from unexpected runtime
exceptions. We have used hybrid of two techniques for efficient detection of
potential point of failure and patch it closest to that to minimize the damage. 
One technique uses type of runtime exception to apply appropriate patch. The
other technique analyze the constraint information both statically and
dynamically to produce patch which will have characteristics as the good values.
Both of the techniques are followed by a taint analysis phase which will
determine which program statements are safe to patch.

We have experimented on \java\ \code{String} API and applied our patching
techniques to some major bugs on some third party \java\ APIs and validate the
patches with the actual patches developed by the programmers in the later
versions.
